# Violin-Basic-Notes

 Add short description of project here > My project helps beginners by letting them know what are the basic notes on the violin. Thsi makes sure they can recognize the notes in an easier fashion and might even be able to let them memorize the notes and over time depend on it less.

## Image Recognition

Image recognition works by taking a set of images and scanning them, after this the somputers tries to guess if they are a part of this group of images or not. In this project I used took a lot of pictures of a note I was playing, by doing this the camera can see what note your playing, if its in the correct position.

## Running this project

1. Run all cells in the classification_interactive.ipynb folder, except for the one at the end. Remember that not all of them load easily and to be careful.
2. Make sure you have a camera and it is the Logitech C270 webcam.
