# Violin-Basic-Notes

 Add short description of project here > My project helps beginner violinists advance their practice through AI. Violins don't have keys, so you need to memorize where fingers need to go to hit a specific note. Teachers help beginners by placing tapes on the violin to show specific notes. However, you need to remove the tapes to continue advancing as a violinists. My project will help beginners this transition by letting them know what are the basic notes on the violin's first position. My goal is to help violinists recognize the notes in an easier fashion and might even be able to let them memorize the notes and over time depend less on AI to practice and play. However, it can support students' practice without the support of a teacher. 

## Image Recognition

Image recognition works by taking a set of images and scanning them, after this the computers try to guess if they are a part of this group of images or not. In this project I took a lot of pictures of a note I was playing, by doing this the camera can see what note your playing and determine if it's in the correct position.

## Running this project

1. Run all cells in the classification_interactive.ipynb folder, except for the one at the end. Remember that not all of them load easily and to be careful.
2. Make sure you have a camera and it is the Logitech C270 webcam.
